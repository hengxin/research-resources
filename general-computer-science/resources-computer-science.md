### Algorithms

- [Algorithm Engineering @ Osnabrück University](http://www-lehre.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/theoinf/index/start)

  Algorithm Engineering focuses on the gap between the purely theoretical analysis of algorithms and the practical 
  run-time performance. Our central topics of interest are, among others,

  - Graph drawing & graph theory (e.g., crossing numbers, upward drawings, clustered drawings,…)
  - Network design (Steiner trees, -networks and relatives)
  - Exact ILP approaches and approximation algorithms (for the above topics; both theoretical and in practice)

### Graph Theory
- [ISGCI: Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions](http://www.graphclasses.org/index.html)
```
ISGCI is an encyclopaedia of graphclasses with an accompanying java application that helps you to 
research what's known about particular graph classes. 
You can:
- check the relation between graph classes and get a witness for the result
- draw clear inclusion diagrams
- colour these diagrams according to the complexity of selected problems
- find the P/NP boundary for a problem
- save your diagrams as Postscript, GraphML or SVG files
- find references on classes, inclusions and algorithms
```
