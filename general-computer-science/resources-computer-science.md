### Algorithms

- [Algorithm Engineering @ Osnabrück University](http://www-lehre.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/theoinf/index/start)

  Algorithm Engineering focuses on the gap between the purely theoretical analysis of algorithms and the practical 
  run-time performance. Our central topics of interest are, among others,

  - Graph drawing & graph theory (e.g., crossing numbers, upward drawings, clustered drawings,…)
  - Network design (Steiner trees, -networks and relatives)
  - Exact ILP approaches and approximation algorithms (for the above topics; both theoretical and in practice)
