# Distributed Shared Memory

## Concepts

### Computer Architecture
- [The DOSMOS project](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/laurent.lefevre/DOSMOS/DSM.html)
```
A distributed shared memory is a mechanism allowing end-users' processes to access shared data 
without using inter-process communications.
```

### Distributed Systems (and Particularly, Distributed Storage Systems)
- [CACM14: Implementing Distributed Shared Memory for Dynamic Networks](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/6/175173-implementing-distributed-shared-memory-for-dynamic-networks/fulltext#R30)
```
A distributed shared memory service emulates a shared memory space comprised of 
readable and writable objects (often called registers) over a networked platform 
consisting of distributed network nodes that communicate by message passing.

### General
- Paper: A Suite Of Formal Definitions For Consistency Criteria In Distributed Shared Memories
```
Numerous protocols implementing a DSM on top of a distributed memory parallel machine 
or on top of a distributed system have been proposed. References [29] and [30] survey systems 
offering a DSM to their users
