# Replicated Distributed Storage Systems

## Background and Motivation
- [EATCS DCColumn14: Reconfiguring Replicated Atomic Storage](http://albcom.lsi.upc.edu/ojs/index.php/beatcs/article/viewFile/43/48)
```
Distributed storage systems have become increasingly important in data centers and other enterprise settings. 
Such systems comprise a network and several nodes (machines) that cooperatively store large amounts of information
for a large number of users. By storing data redundantly, for example using replication over several nodes, 
the system can tolerate the failure of some of its nodes without losing data.

## Model
- [EATCS DCColumn14: Reconfiguring Replicated Atomic Storage](http://albcom.lsi.upc.edu/ojs/index.php/beatcs/article/viewFile/43/48)
```
We consider a distributed system with two types of nodes: storage nodes keep data for applications and users, 
while client nodes (or simply clients) issue requests to read and write data on storage nodes. 
The term node refers to a storage node or a client node.
A network allows nodes to communicate. We assume there is a link between every pair of nodes, which need not be a physical link.
