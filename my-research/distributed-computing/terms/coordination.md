# Coordination

- [CSUR94: The Interdisciplinary Study of Coordination](http://ccs.mit.edu/papers/CCSWP157.html)
```
Coordination is managing dependencies between activities.
```
```
Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, 
simultaneity constraints, and task/subtask dependencies.

```
Coordination [1] is a programming paradigm whose goal is to separate the definition of 
the individual behavior of application components from the mechanics of their interaction. 
This goal is usually achieved by using either *message passing* or *data sharing* as a model for interaction.
