``Architects draw detailed blueprints before a brick is laid or a nail is hammered. Programmers and software engineers seldom do. A blueprint for software is called a specification. The need for extremely rigorous specifications before coding complex or critical systems should be obvious—especially for concurrent and distributed systems. This talk explains why some sort of specification should be written for any software.``

## Books
- [Synthesis Lectures on Distributed Computing Theory](http://www.morganclaypool.com/toc/dct/1/1)
> Synthesis Lectures on Distributed Computing Theory is edited by Jennifer Welch of Texas A&M University and Nancy Lynch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The series publishes  50- to 150-page publications on topics pertaining to distributed computing theory. The scope largely follows the purview of premier information and computer science conferences, such as ACM PODC, DISC, SPAA, OPODIS, CONCUR, DialM-POMC, ICDCS, SODA, Sirocco, SSS, and related conferences. Potential topics include, but not are limited to: distributed algorithms and lower bounds, algorithm design methods, formal modeling and verification of distributed algorithms, and concurrent data structures.
